Web server for 3D printing

My Creality Ender 5 3d printer connected to the old laptop where I ran this server and don't need to mess between two computers any more.

Usage is simple, just run: _web.py_ and point your web browser to the server/port specifed in _config.cfg_. Upload your .gcode file and click on the filename to start printing.

_stream.py_ will be used to send g-code to your printer.

Enjoy!
